Hi!  My name is Maria. <br> <br>
I am a programmer by trade, even though I have a degree in Mathematics.
I graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 2014 and have been working as a software engineer ever since.
I love working on personal projects in my free time, so I started a blog to document the process.  In my blog, you'll find my most recent updates about what I'm currently working on.
<br><br>
At Cal Poly, I was particularly active in two clubs - the Cal Poly Amateur Radio Club (CPARC) and White Hat cybersecurity club.  I enjoy working with hardware, and if I couldn't study computer science, my second choice would've probably been EE. <br>
I'm still looking for my dream job, which will probably be some combination of robotics, machine learning, and hopefully some math.
<br><br>
Other than nerdy engineering things, I love playing chess, baking, and rock climbing (and I'm always looking for climbing partners). <br>
+Feel free to <a href="mailto:mpikusov@gmail.com">contact me</a> to talk about project ideas, tech events, Bay Area life, jobs, or anything else you find interesting.
